# Travelopia
1. Created a fluied banner component that would fill the specified window in its entirety.  
2. Fixed header and footer of 100px. 
3. To make it SEO-friendly, I adhered to the semantic structure. 
4. To optimize the photos for the Hero Banner, picture tag was used. 
5. Utilized display flex to make the content of the window center aligned. 
6. Because the js for the alert window only one line of code, it was written inside the body tag rather than   in a separate file.
